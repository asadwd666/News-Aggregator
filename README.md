# NewsAggregator API Documentation

## Overview

The **NewsAggregator** project is a system designed to fetch, store, and manage news articles from three major APIs: **New York Times**, **BBC News**, and **NewsAPI**. Articles are collected daily using a scheduled task, and users can manually fetch them as needed. The system provides various API endpoints to handle user registration, login, preferences, and article management.

3. Run the following command to clone the repository:

   cd news-generation-api
   ```

---
## Composer
First install the composer dependencies:
`composer install`

---

## Docker Setup
1. build the containers:
`docker-compose build --no-cache`

2. Run the containers:
`docker-compose up -d`

3. Access URL:
`http://127.0.0.1:8081`

4. The following ports are exposed:
- **App:** 8081 (http://127.0.0.1:8081)
- **MySQL:** 3307 (alternatively try 3306 if 3307 is not working for you)
- **PhpMyAdmin:** 8080 (http://127.0.0.1:8080)
- **Swagger:** 8082 (http://127.0.0.1:8082)

---
## Swagger API Documentation
I have already added the required code to the docker-compose.yml file to run the Swagger API documentation. You can access it after running the containers by visiting the following URL:

`http://127.0.0.1:8082`

I added the /swagger/swagger.yml file to make it work for the above URL.

Alternatively you can open the file in Phpstorm and click on the Swagger icon to view the API documentation.
Or you can open the file in a browser and view the API documentation.
Just in case for some reason it is not working on your end.

But its working fine on my end and I have tested it.
